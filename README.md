# File-Hider-OTP-and-Email-Authentication-Project
The primary objective of the File Hider with OTP and Email Authentication project is to develop a secure and user-friendly application that enables users to protect sensitive files by hiding them and ensuring access only through robust authentication mechanisms. The application aims to incorporate the following functionalities:
1.File Hiding:Implement a feature to hide or encrypt files, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
2.OTP-Based Authentication:Generate and validate one-time passwords (OTPs) for secure user authentication during critical operations like un-hiding files or accessing the application.
3.Email Integration:Send OTPs and other security notifications to the user's registered email address, enhancing the application's security and usability.
4.User-Friendly Interface:Provide an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface for file management and authentication.
